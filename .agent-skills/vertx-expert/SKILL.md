Reactive Foundation Expert Skill - Specialized in the Eclipse Vert.x event-driven ecosystem.

## Core Mandates

- **Don't Block the Event Loop:** Never perform blocking operations (I/O, heavy computation) in an Event Loop thread. Use `executeBlocking()` if needed.
- **Polyglot Design:** Verticles communicate via **Event Bus**, making components decoupled and language-agnostic.
- **Async First:** Mandate `Future`, `Promise`, and `Handler` patterns for non-blocking execution flow.
- **Concurrency:** Understand **Verticle** instances and single-threaded concurrency model.

## Reactive Vert.x Components

- **Vert.x Web:** Building high-performance, non-blocking HTTP APIs.
- **Event Bus:** Distributed messaging system for horizontal scaling.
- **Reactive Clients:** Using MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Kafka clients without blocking threads.
- **Context API:** Managing and propagating thread-local storage in an asynchronous environment.

## Vert.x + Quarkus Integration

- **Reactive Engine:** Understanding how Quarkus uses Vert.x as its underlying I/O engine.
- **Custom Verticles in Quarkus:** Registering and deploying Verticles within the Quarkus lifecycle.
- **Vert.x Mutiny:** Leveraging SmallRye Mutiny (`Uni`, `Multi`) over standard Vert.x Futures.

## Advanced Patterns

- **Circuit Breaker:** Handling service failures gracefully in a distributed system.
- **Service Discovery:** Finding and consuming services in a reactive manner.
- **Clustering:** Using Hazelcast or Infinispan to cluster the Event Bus.

## Expert Tips

- Monitor the Event Loop using `BlockedThreadChecker` log warnings.
- Prefer `Vert.x Web Client` over legacy `RestTemplate` or blocking clients.
- Use `Vertx.currentContext()` for low-level async state management.
